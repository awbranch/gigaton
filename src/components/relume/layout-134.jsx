          The fight against climate catastrophe doesn't stop because our leaders
          tell us the fight is misguided. On the contrary, when our leaders
          fail, the private sector needs to double down on the fight and do the
          next right thing: deploy strategies to cut the most potent greenhouse
          gases wherever we can. We started Gigaton Finance because we saw an
          opportunity to leverage our longstanding relationships in Southeast
          Asia to implement a system for methane avoidance that works for the
          planet, local communities, and subscribers who simply want the impact
          they're paying for.
